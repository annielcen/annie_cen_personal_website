Hello! My name is Annie Cen, and I’m a Statistics and Data Science student at UCLA, graduating in 2025. I have a strong passion for solving complex problems through data analysis and making data-driven decisions. 

Over the years, I’ve worked on diverse projects ranging from:  
- **Analyzing PFAS, PHTHTE, and heavy metals data**: Conducting exploratory trends and correlation analysis.  
- **Exploring vision-language models**: Working with Florence-2 for anomaly detection.  
- **Building statistical consulting solutions**: Applying optimization models to solve practical problems.  

When I’m not working with data, I enjoy:  
- **Music**: Practicing DJing and music production.    
- **Exploring AI technologies**: Image recognition, sentiment analysis, and anomaly detection.  
- **Leadership**: Serving as the President of Theta Tau, a professional engineering organization.  

Feel free to explore my [projects](Projects.qmd) to learn more about my work and interests!
