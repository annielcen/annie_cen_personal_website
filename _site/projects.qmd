Welcome to my projects page! Below are some of the exciting projects I’ve worked on :)
---

## 1. **PFAS, PHTHTE, and Heavy Metals Analysis** - University of North Carolina, Charlotte
- **Description**: Conducted exploratory data analysis on PFAS, PHTHTE, and heavy metals data from 1999–2018. Identified trends, correlations, and patterns over time with final goal of creating dashboard.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, seasborn, HTML
- **Highlights**:
  - Cleaned and preprocessed data from multiple years.   
  - Visualized distributions and created heatmaps of correlations.    
  - Stratified data by demographics (e.g., gender and age).    
  - Utlized HTML to create foundational structure of dashboard.
